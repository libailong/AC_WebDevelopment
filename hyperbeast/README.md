Designed for use with [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/), this
repository contains the starter for Laboratory 10 in Computer Science 103.

## Introduction

Please review the carefully formatted assignment sheet for this project as it
provides more details about the steps that a computer scientist should take to
complete this assignment. You can view this assignment sheet by visiting the
listing of laboratories on the course web site.

## Learning

If you have not done so already, please read all of the relevant [GitHub
Guides](https://guides.github.com/) that explain how to use many of the
features that GitHub provides. In particular, please make sure that you have
read the following GitHub guides: [Mastering
Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), [Hello
World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/), and [Documenting
Your Projects on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/). Each of
these guides will help you to understand how to use both
[GitHub](http://github.com) and [GitHub
Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/). Finally, since this is the final
project, please read all of the relevant chapters in the textbook for this
course.

## Travis

This assignment uses [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/) to automatically run
a checking program every time you commit to your GitHub repository. The
checking will start as soon as you have accepted the assignment, thus creating
your own private repository, and the course instructor enables Travis for it. If
you are using Travis for the first time, you will need to authorize Travis CI to
access the private repositories that you created on GitHub.

## Problems

If you have found a problem with this assignment's provided source code, then
you can go to the [Computer Science 103 Lab 10
Starter](https://github.com/Allegheny-Computer-Science-103-S2018/cs103-S2018-lab10-starter)
repository and create an issue by clicking the "Issues" tab and then clicking
the green "New Issue" button. If you discover a problem with the laboratory
assignment sheet, then please raise an issue in the
[cs103-S2018-sheets](https://github.com/Allegheny-Computer-Science-103-S2018/cs103-S2018-sheets)
repository and mention this assignment.

Students who find, and use the appropriate GitHub issue tracker to correctly
document, a mistake in any aspect of this laboratory assignment will receive
free laptop stickers and extra credit towards their grade for it.

## Assistance

If you are having trouble completing any part of this project, then please talk
with either the course instructor or a teaching assistant during the laboratory
session. Alternatively, you may ask questions in the Slack team for this
course. Finally, you can schedule a meeting during the course instructor's
office hours.
