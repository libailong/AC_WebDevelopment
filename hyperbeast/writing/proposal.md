# Hypebeast things

## Proposal by GoodTeam(Zijun Xia & Bailong Li) 

### Abstract

For this final project, our group decided to choose the sixth topic: Student-Designed Project which we plan to create a web site about the hypebeast(The fashion things). We will make a mobile-ready and responsive design web site.

### Main Ideas

For the content, the main goal of our team  is going to create "Hypebeast" website which is a streetwear introduction website including Off-White, Supreme, Bape, Stussy, HUF, Palace, Air Jordan and some other brands. We are going to introduce the history, price and development in the future of these hyper beast. We plane to let users know the different brands' features in different countries.

### Tasks and plans

Firstly, we planed to make a menu bar on the top of the web that the users can choose click the different brands, some pictures and some short descriptions of those brands. In order to create that, we may use the bootstrap frame. Additionally, we will also use the grid system to make the responsive design can be worked on our web site. We will use some form, links, and image knowledge to build the web site.
