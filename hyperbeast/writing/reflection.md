# Reflection by Bailong Li and Zijun Xia

This lab required me to explore the real-world applications of web development.
After finish this final project, I do feel creating a whole website is tougher that I think before.

I am Zijun and here is my insights for this project. when I work on this Project, as a leader of team, I took more responsibility of this website. After our team decided what we are going to do for `"HYPERBEAST" `, I created that history page and part of gallery pages and about page. I feel this project is a kind of easy for me because I did hard work for this semester. In this project, I am using the knowledge that I learned through this semester.

I am Bailong and here is my insights for this project. When I work on this project, as a member of this team, I am working on the Home page and part of the gallery pages. I feel this project is a good chance for me to applicate the knowledge that I learned before. Creating a responsive website is a task for me but we are using bootstrap to solve that task.

The team insights is really interesting for us. Both of us like streetwear so when we realize we can create a website about that, we are excited and cannot wait to work on that.
